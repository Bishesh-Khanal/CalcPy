# CalcPy

An online multi-purpose calculator with all the basic advanced features such as:

## Scientific Calculator

Created using django for the back-end and javascript for the front-end.

The server-side back end was done by me while the front end and client-side backend was done by Manish Pokhrel( https://github.com/janedotexe )

For 2D graphing we used the Desmos API
For 3D graphing we used the Mathpix 3D grapher
